#  Jira Client in Swift (W.I.P.)
This is currently a limited client. Hope to, over time, expand to more of the endpoints.

# OpenAPI Doc
I did have to make some changes to the openapi doc. They were either missing parameters, did not have all response types, incorrect response types, or difficult to manage request body types.

# Tests
Currently no unit tests are being done. Still learning about that.
